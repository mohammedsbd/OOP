# Java Cab Booking System

## Project Overview

The **Java Cab Booking System** is a console-based application designed to demonstrate core object-oriented programming principles using Java and MySQL. The system allows customers to register, book rides, and view available drivers through a clean Command Line Interface (CLI). Drivers can be managed, and bookings tracked efficiently with persistent storage in a MySQL database.

**Key Features:**

- Customer Registration & Management  
- Driver Registration & Management  
- Booking System with pickup/drop locations  
- Booking Status Tracking (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)  
- Driver Availability Management  
- MySQL Database Integration for persistence  
- Robust Exception Handling and validation  
- Object-Oriented Design using Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism  
- File I/O Logging for auditing actions

## Setup and Execution Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 11 or higher  
- MySQL server installed and running  
- IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode)  
- Basic knowledge of command line operations  

### Database Setup

1. Install MySQL server if you haven't already.  
2. Create the database and tables by running the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE cbs2;

USE cbs2;

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE drivers (
    driver_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    vehicle_no VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE bookings (
    booking_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    driver_id INT NULL,
    pickup_location VARCHAR(100),
    drop_location VARCHAR(100),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (driver_id) REFERENCES drivers(driver_id)
);
Update the DBConnection class in the util package with your MySQL username and password.
